# Disease Prediction Using ML

###### This is a project we developed for the hackathon at the Convergence event. Our goal was to create a machine learning model that can predict diseases based on symptoms and other relevant information. We used a dataset from Kaggle and tried out various algorithms to determine which one had the best accuracy. Our results showed that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) had the best accuracy, so we chose to use that for our model.

### Frontend and Hosting
We used Streamlit for the frontend of our web-based application and for hosting it. This made it easy for users to input their symptoms and get the top result of what they could possibly have.

### Target Group
Our target group is patients who are at risk of developing a specific disease, such as those with a family history or certain lifestyle factors. By providing information about a patient's likelihood of developing a disease, we hope to empower individuals to take control of their health and make more informed decisions about their medical care.

**Fun Fact**
Our model is trained on data from previous patients who experienced similar symptoms.

### Empowering Individuals
Our goal is to empower individuals to take control of their health and make more informed decisions about their medical care. We believe that by providing accurate and personalized information, we can help individuals make more informed decisions about their health and ultimately improve their overall well-being.

### Scope
1. Personalized results - We can use neural networks to identify anomalies and also the ability to give out results based on new symptoms too.
2. Improvising dataset - Having a credible and large dataset is the key for working of the algorithm.
3. Maps and Emergencies - We can use IP addresses to get their current location and find out nearest hospitals for emergencies.
4. Giving Data - Users being more informed is important, we will try to roll out more credible information for them to take informed decision.


### Limitations
1. Lack of credible dataset
2. Noise in data
3. Limited context: we're not taking account of the patient's history
4. Complexity of disease: Some diseases may have multiple causes and symptoms that are hard to identify and predict
5. Explainability: We don't know how the model predicted that exact decision
6. Ethical concerns: There is a risk of discrimination against certain groups of individuals
